        <h2>HCI</h2>
        <p> Typically an umbrella term for UX, UI, and CS, HCI is a multidisciplinaary field that establishes cognitive relationships between interfaces and user behvaior. </p>
        <p> It's my belief that a good understanding of HCI is crucial for creating and maintaining interfaces that are usable, useful, and accesssable.</p>
        <p> Below are some of my past projects, redesigns, and case studies that accomplish those goals.</p>

        <h3> Interface Redesign - RockAuto</h3>
        <p> This was a semester-long endeavor that required students to develop a case study for a popular website. This included conducting heuristic evaluations, setting up and evaluating user task paths, and even creating a prototypical redesign to address discovered pain points.  </p>
        <p> The website I chose to redesign was RockAuto, a popular online site for finding and purchasing car parts, as well as staying connected to an online automotive enthusiast community. </p>
        <p> Below are some selections of the project. </p>
    </section>    

    <section id="redesign-task">
        <h4> Task Matrix/Analysis </h4>
        <p>The Task Matrix and Task Analysis were projects aimed at clarifying various user groups that interacted with the interface, and the specific pathways that users engage in to complete their tasks.  </p>
        <p> This sample highlightss 2 main user groups, and a general HTA evaluation of completing a task like purchasing a part for a car. </p>

    <section id="heuristic">
        <h4> Heuristic Evaluation </h4>
        <p> The Heuristic Evaluation was a chance to identify potential inaccuracies, pain points, or general areas of the interface that did not constitute good design.  </p>
        <p> The below sample is an example of the Evaluation that highlights misleading portions of the interface. </p>

    <section id="prototype">
        <h4>Prototype Redesign - Figma </h4>
        <p>This prototype redesign showcases 2 different user paths; creating an account, and finding and adding an item to cart. </p>
        <p>The prototype was completed in Figma and showcases a redesign for how the new website would look, and a new seamless transition between screens. </p>
        <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2F9ltEb5WQG8WskEnR3fOR1c%2FGroup-2--ACN6342--Spring-2023%3Ftype%3Ddesign%26node-id%3D170-451%26t%3D9t93gOcgLpcGEa5S-1%26scaling%3Dscale-down%26page-id%3D136%253A1640%26starting-point-node-id%3D170%253A451%26mode%3Ddesign" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p> The 2 task-paths that can be explored in the prototype above are the "Shop" and "Login/Create Account" actions. </p>

        <h3> Memory and UX Design</h3>
        <p> This presentation was a synthesis of information from the Nielsen Norman Group and a 1974 paper by Baddeley and Hitch that contextualize our memory system constraints, and how that should impact interface design.   </p>
